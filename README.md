# HSG_ExSUM_NER
This repository presents and compares HeterSUMGraph and variants doing extractive summarization, named entity recognition or both.  
HeterSUMGraph and variants use GATv2Conv (from torch_geometric).  

HeterSUMGraph using GATv2Conv is the best variant of HeterSUMGraph, better than original HeterSUMGraph on NYT50, for more information
see: [https://github.com/Baragouine/HeterSUMGraph](https://github.com/Baragouine/HeterSUMGraph)

The dataset is a part of general geography, architecture town planning and geology French wikipedia articles.
